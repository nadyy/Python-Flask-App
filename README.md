# Python-Flask-App

This project is a little complete guide to create a web application using Python, from A to Z.

In the project folder, you will have two main projects : app which is a basic Flask application and flask-app which is a flask MVC application.

You can go through the code and see how the app works, but if you need more details an explanations on every step, you can take the guide from Amazon named: "Learn how to build web applications with Python" for English version, and "Apprenez Ã  programmer des applications Web avec Python" for french version.

Note that the initial version of the code was in french, that is why you may see french comments in the code. But the process is the same and those comments are translated in the guide document.

Here is the links to take de guides:
